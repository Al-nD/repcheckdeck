# repcheckdeck
A prevalent problem that plagues the gym community is not getting full ROM (range of motion) in exercises. This, combined with how muscle is built -- tearing the fibers by fully stretching and contracting the tissue -- poses a severe issue towards the goal of gaining muscle mass. However, using our repcheckdeck, we can count the true amount of full ROM reps that a person does, providing an accurate statistic of how much real work one puts into lifting. By eliminating mistakes like half-repping or not locking out at the top of an exercise, the repcheckdeck helps people maximize their gains and provides other supplementary benefits, like how many calories one has burned. 

#how deos the rep get checked on the deck

We used opencv pose detection to see the position of the appendages of the person, and used trigonometry to determine how deep one should go during a rep. When a rep is fully completed, the calorie counter increases in accordance with the effort it takes to complete the rep. 

#plans for the future

In the future, we plan to expand our services from bench press and shoulder press to other exercises such as squats, rows, and curls.
